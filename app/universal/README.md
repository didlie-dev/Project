What  the  fvk am I doing with this?

************************************

So, the concept is this:
*every user has the opportunity to own a namespace.
*every user can post to a namespace with or without owning it.
*when a user owns a namespace they can post the first listing and 'mine' the site.

**minNing the site means: maintaining the database and submitting new listings.
**other users do not submit listings directly; they must first connect to a miner.

///CHALLENGES:

*the website itself must somehow make a list of available miners, by keeping a list of nodes that are pinging it.
**each miner must have a URL.

--to create this arrangement, NEED: 1) A SERVER, 2) A NODE, 3) A BROWSER CLIENT

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT ARE 2 DEDICATED URLS.
